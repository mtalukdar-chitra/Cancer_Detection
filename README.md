# Cancer_Detection
This repository contains code for a cancer prediction system using machine learning techniques. The primary task is to classify tumor cells as either benign (B) or malignant (M) based on certain features. The system achieves an accuracy of 99% using ensemble techniques by using the VotingClassifier from the Scikit-Learn library.
